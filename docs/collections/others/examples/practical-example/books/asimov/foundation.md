## About the Book

Foundation is the first novel in Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy (later expanded to the Foundation series). It introduces the science of psychohistory and follows the establishment of the Foundation to preserve knowledge during the predicted fall of the Galactic Empire.

## Synopsis

For twelve thousand years the Galactic Empire has ruled supreme. Now it is dying. But only Hari Seldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, can see into the future—to a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. To preserve knowledge and save mankind, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire—both scientists and scholars—and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the Galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for future generations. He calls his sanctuary the Foundation.

But soon the fledgling Foundation finds itself at the mercy of corrupt warlords rising in the wake of the receding Empire. Mankind's last best hope is faced with an agonizing choice: submit to the barbarians and be overrun—or fight them and be destroyed.

## Part I: The Psychohistorians

### Chapter 1

Hari Seldon did not like the new tower. It was too tall, too imposing, too modern. The view from his office on the eighty-seventh floor was spectacular—the entire Imperial Sector spread out before him in geometric perfection—but it lacked the warmth of his old quarters in Streeling University.

"Commissioner," his assistant Gaal Dornick interrupted his reverie, "the trial begins in two hours."

Seldon turned from the window. Gaal was young, barely past thirty, with the eager expression of someone who still believed mathematics could save the world. Perhaps it could. That was what psychohistory was all about.

"The trial is a formality," Seldon said. "The Commission of Public Safety has already made its decision. We are to be exiled to Terminus."

"Exile?" Gaal's face showed alarm. "But your work—"

"Will continue on Terminus. That is precisely what I've planned." Seldon smiled. "Sometimes, Gaal, one must use the Empire's own momentum against it. They think they're silencing us. In reality, they're sending us exactly where we need to be."

### Chapter 2

The Encyclopedia Foundation began its work on Terminus exactly as Hari Seldon had foreseen. Fifty years had passed since the exile, and the Foundation's mission—to compile the Encyclopedia Galactica—proceeded on schedule.

Or so everyone believed.

Salvor Hardin, the current Mayor of Terminus City, knew better. At thirty-two, he was the youngest mayor in the Foundation's history, and he had no interest in encyclopedias.

"Gentlemen," he addressed the Board of Trustees, "we face our first Seldon Crisis."

The board members looked confused. The term meant nothing to them.

"Dr. Seldon predicted that we would face a series of crises," Hardin explained. "Moments when the Foundation's survival hangs in the balance. This is the first."

"What crisis?" demanded Lord Dorwin's representative. "The Four Kingdoms are quarreling among themselves. We are perfectly safe."

"No," Hardin said flatly. "Anacreon is preparing to annex us. And the Empire is too weak to help."

## Part II: The Encyclopedists

The crisis came exactly when Hardin predicted. Anacreon, the nearest of the Four Kingdoms, demanded the Foundation's submission. The Encyclopedists wanted to appeal to the Emperor. Hardin knew the Empire was beyond help.

"Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent," Hardin announced at the crucial council meeting. "We will use something more powerful than weapons."

"What?" demanded the lead Encyclopedist.

"Religion."

## Part III: The Mayors

Fifty years after the Anacreonic crisis, the Foundation had transformed the Four Kingdoms through religion. Nuclear power, controlled by the Foundation's priests, was seen as sacred. The kingdoms depended on the Foundation for their technology.

But a new crisis emerged. Prince Regent Wienis of Anacreon wanted to break free of Foundation control. He planned to capture Foundation technology for himself.

Hardin, now in his eighties, faced his second Seldon Crisis with the same calm he had shown with the first.

"The Time Vault will open tomorrow," he told the current generation of Foundation leaders. "Hari Seldon will speak to us."

## Part IV: The Traders

Generations passed. The Foundation expanded its influence through trade rather than religion. Trader princes, equipped with atomic gadgets, spread across the galaxy, creating markets and dependencies.

Limmar Ponyets was one such trader. When his colleague was imprisoned on the planet Askone for possessing nuclear technology—forbidden by Askonian religion—Ponyets had to find a way to free him without violating the planet's taboos.

His solution was elegant: transmute iron into gold using nuclear transmutation. The Grand Master of Askone couldn't resist the lure of wealth. In exchange for Ponyets's "magical" gold-making machine, the prisoner was freed and the Foundation gained a new trading partner.

## Part V: The Merchant Princes

Hober Mallow, Master Trader and future Mayor of the Foundation, faced the most complex crisis yet. The neighboring Korellian Republic showed signs of independence from the Foundation. Worse, there were rumors of Imperial intervention.

Mallow's journey to Korell revealed the truth: the Korellian government had obtained Imperial military technology. The Empire, though dying, was not quite dead.

But Mallow had a plan. Instead of military confrontation, he created economic dependency. Korellian civilization became utterly reliant on Foundation goods. When Korell attacked, Mallow simply cut off trade.

Within months, the Korellian economy collapsed. The people revolted against their government. The Foundation won without firing a shot.

## Epilogue: The Seldon Plan

In the Time Vault, a holographic recording of Hari Seldon appeared at precisely the calculated moment.

"If you're seeing this," the recording said, "then the Foundation has successfully navigated its first series of crises. The Encyclopedia was never the real goal. You are. The Foundation itself is the repository of human knowledge—not in books, but in the society you're building."

"The Empire will continue to fall. But because of what you've accomplished here, the dark age will last only a thousand years instead of thirty thousand. And at the end, a new Empire will rise—stronger, wiser, and built on the knowledge you've preserved."

"Remember: violence is the last refuge of the incompetent. Economic power is more permanent than military power. And above all, the Seldon Plan continues."

The recording faded. The Foundation leaders looked at each other, understanding at last the true scope of Seldon's vision.

The Foundation was not just preserving civilization.

It was building the next one.
